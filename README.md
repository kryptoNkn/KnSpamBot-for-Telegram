# About Bot

I created a Telegram bot in Python that can send messages to any user.

# How to use?

1. Install the requests library.
```sh
pip install requests
```

This command will download and install the latest version of the requests library and all required dependencies.

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, make sure you use the pip that matches the version of Python you want. For example, for Python 3, you can use pip3:

```sh
pip3 install requests
```

Once installed, you can import the requests library into your bot script.

```python
import requests
```

2. You need to know your user ID, or the ID of the user you want to send messages to. You can find out your user ID in this Telegram bot: @getmyid_bot. Detailed instructions on how to use the bot are in its description. Insert the required data into the code.
3. Create your bot via @BotFather and paste your bot token into the code.
4. Write the missing data in the code and run it.

# Flaws:

* In order for the bot to be able to send messages, the user needs to launch it.
* You need to know the ID of the user you want to send messages to (you can find it by forwarding any message from this user to the bot @getmyid_bot).

# Conclusion

This code allows you to send the same message multiple times to each user. Make sure you use this method with respect for the privacy and preferences of users to avoid spam and unwanted messages.
